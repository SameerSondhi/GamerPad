## General Information
- I felt inspired to create a UI that could help users find and discover unreleased and highly anticipated video games for any platform. A lot of these games will soon become new releases, but I intend to regularly update the API request to ensure that users can be up to date with the latest titles. 


## Technologies Used
- Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: React
- Styling: Bootstrap, CSS
- Databases: None (This is a front end application)
- APIs: RAWG API


## Features
Ready features:
- The most recent version of this application features a catalog page complete with pagination (2 pages total) 
- Users can browse up and coming video game titles, view the release dates, as well as, see which platforms each game can be played on
- If the user clicks on the title of each game, they can view the description of the game in a centered modal
- This app is truly an SPA, so users can quickly check if there are any releases coming up around the corner
- Main page and features are mobile responsive and work brilliantly on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14" MacBook Pro.
